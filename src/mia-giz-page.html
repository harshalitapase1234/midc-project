        Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises; Government of India &
        Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH are
        implementing a bilateral cooperation project-
        <b>'Innovation, Modernization & Qualification'</b> (MSME INNO)''. This
        project aims to improve the local innovation ecosystem through fostering
        cooperation between different stakeholders and strengthening the innovation
        management capacity and sustainability of MSMEs in India. The project seeks
        to strengthen the innovation system by systematically fostering cooperation
        between companies, research institutions, government, service providers and
        larger enterprises for introduction and dissemination of new technologies,
        products, processes and/or business model innovation.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        MSME INNO is working with selected Business Membership Organizations (BMOs)
        to act as an 'innovation-enabler' so that they develop systemic
        collaborations and linkages with technical/research/academic institutes;
        large industries; supply chain partners; public institutions & other
        relevant stakeholders to offer different 'innovation assistance services' to
        their member MSMEs. The project will be supporting these BMOs so that they
        in turn will support their MSMEs to ideate (product/ process/ business model
        innovation), leverage public funds, network with knowledge and technology
        institutions etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nagpur is one of the locations where MSME INNO has been working. MSME INNO
        has collaborated with MIA, academic institutions like VNIT, Shri Ramdeobaba
        College of Engineering & Management, KDK College of Engineering and Cummins
        College of Engineering for Women and few other government agencies in the
        region to foster cooperation between industry, academia and government and
        thereby strengthen the innovation capacity and sustainability of MSMEs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We established an Innovation Facilitation Center representing SMEs of
        Automotive, Engineering, Foundries and related sector. The Innovation
        Facilitation Cell is established and integrated within the functioning of
        the BMO and stated organizing innovation promotion programmes/events on a
        regular basis and for creating & nurturing linkages with critical
        stakeholders that influence innovation ecosystem for its member MSMEs in
        Nagpur Cluster.
      </p>
      <p>The specific objectives of IFC will be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Organising information and knowledge programmes for promoting innovation
          in SMEs
        </li>
        <li>
          Introducing MSMEs to innovation practices & helping them develop system of
          innovation
        </li>
        <li>
          Supporting to create and nurture linkages with stakeholders (buyers,
          academia, government, banks etc) for promoting innovation at cluster level
        </li>
        <li>
          Supporting to develop and offer 'innovation assistance services' for MSMEs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Major Activities of MIA - GIZ Innovation Facilitation Cell for Year 2019
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Organize regular training/ workshops and factory visits on Intervention
          Areas like:
          <ul>
            <li>Welding Technology : Towards Zero Defect</li>
            <li>Best practices in foundry</li>
            <li>
              Product Quality Improvement and Certification by means of
              Standardization and Testing for Electronics Industry
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Student Innovation Projects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At present more than 100 students of 4 institutes are working on 30 industry
        problems. This activity commenced from December 2018. In the first phase 18
        Industries participated in this activity. We at MIA-GIZ IFC need active
        participation from MIA members to generate a data bank of technical problems
        faced by MSMEs and we will organize student-innovation projects every year
        under Innovation cell taking problem statements from industries as the
        subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        We as Innovation Cell planned regular networking meets and events to seek
        inputs from their members and accordingly will organize awareness and
        capacity building initiatives.
